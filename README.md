- **Graphics API**: OpenGL

## Features

- **Player Movement**: The player can freely move around the virtual gallery using keyboard.
- **Drinking Mechanism**: Players can interact with various alcohol displays and choose to "drink" in the virtual world. As they consume more alcohol, their level of in-game intoxication increases, leading to visual distortions and impaired control, simulating the effects of drunkenness.
